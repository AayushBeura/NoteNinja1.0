NoteNinja 1.0 is a Streamlit application designed to simplify meeting documentation. It generates Minutes of Meeting (MOM) from audio input (microphone or system audio), uploaded audio files (WAV), or uploaded PDF files using Google's Gemini AI. This project is a fusion of speech recognition, AI-powered text generation, and PDF handling.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Real-Time System Audio Recording & Transcription:** Capture audio from your system's default output device, transcribing it using Google's Speech Recognition API.
-   **Multi-threading for Audio Processing:** System audio is processed efficiently using a multithreading technique, by chunking the audio data for a smoother experience.
-   **Microphone Recording:** Record and transcribe audio directly from your microphone.
-   **Audio File Upload:** Transcribe and summarize audio from uploaded WAV files.
-    **PDF File Upload:** Upload and summarize text from PDF files.
-   **AI-Powered MOM Generation:** Generate informative meeting summaries using Gemini AI.
-   **Downloadable PDF Output:** Save generated MOMs as downloadable PDF files.
- **Robust Error Handling:** The app has more robust error handling and checks for various edge cases, especially while handling PDF files.
- **User-Friendly Instructions:** Easy to use, with clear user friendly instructions.
